# Google 工程实践指南(Google Engineering Practices Documentation中文版)

Google has many generalized engineering practices that cover all languages and
all projects. These documents represent our collective experience of various
best practices that we have developed over time. It is possible that open source
projects or other organizations would benefit from this knowledge, so we work to
make it available publicly when possible.
Google 保存了很多通用的工程实践经验， 这些实践经验涵盖了所有语言和项目。 这些文档是我们长久以来大量最佳开发实践的经验结晶。
我们认为这些经验可能对开源项目或者整个行业有益，所以将其开源。
